# Java-React Project Brief


## Investment App

### Goals

* Create a front-end web application using React with a Spring/Java back-end to view investment performance over various periods for selected markets.
* Solo project but incorporate agile methods e.g. rapid development of working MVP using TDD where relevant, (at least) daily review and selection of priority extension, which will be a working incremental iteration from the MVP.


### MVP

* The user should be able to select one of a number of popular investment markets.
* The user should be able to access and view price and performance information over various periods for the selected market.
* The user should be able to View, Add, Edit and Remove markets.
* The user should be able to View, Add, Edit and Remove individual price data for each market.

### EXTENSIONS

* The user can view a chart of the price data.
* The user can view derivatives of the price data on the chart - e.g. moving averages or change in price information.
* The user can compare the price and performance information of different markets.
* The user can change the time period over which the performance data and/or chart is presented.
* The user user can upload price data from an API or CSV file (or other data file type).
* The user can input proposed trade details (market, direction, size, time of proposed trade) for a selected market (the trade details will be saved but the trade will not be implemented by the app).
